# QF Network - Spec Repository  

The repository serves as the hub for accumulating and managing project knowledge. It is a living document that continuously evolves with the latest insights, decisions, and technical specifications. This repository is the foundation for our task and knowledge management processes, ensuring that development efforts are transparent, well-documented, and aligned with organizational goals.  

By leveraging **GitHub Projects** we enable real-time tracking of progress and workflows.

### Key Entities in the Project 

- **Cases**  
  Cases are product-focused GitHub Issues that define user value propositions and agent experiences. They are created and modified through stakeholder decisions, serving as strategic drivers that map agent outcomes to experiments and coordinate system-wide development efforts. 

- **Experiments**  
  Experiments are technical GitHub Issues (sub-issues of Cases) representing focused technical hypotheses to be tested through implementation and validation. Each Experiment is assigned an owner responsible for leading both the technical implementation and validation phases, with results documented through PRs to ensure findings are integrated into the knowledge repository.

- **Tasks**  
  Tasks are engineering work items (sub-issues of Experiments) assigned to individual engineers and tracked via GitHub Project boards. Tasks may reside in various repositories and are completed when documented PRs are submitted. The Experiment owner sets acceptance criteria and ensures Tasks contribute to broader Experiment goals.

## Getting Started  

- **Check the Project Board** – See the current progress and Tasks.  
- **Explore the Issues** – Review existing Cases and Experiments to find areas where you can contribute.
- **Submit PRs** – Document your findings and contribute by submitting pull requests that enhance the knowledge repository.
