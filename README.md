# QF Network - Spec Repository  

The repository serves as the hub for accumulating and managing project knowledge. It is a living document that continuously evolves with the latest insights, decisions, and technical specifications. This repository is the foundation for our task and knowledge management processes, ensuring that development efforts are transparent, well-documented, and aligned with organizational goals.  

By leveraging **GitHub Projects** we enable real-time tracking of progress and workflows.

### Key entities in the Project 

- **Cases**  
  Cases define high-level R&D goals and priorities. They are a specific type of GitHub Issue created and modified solely through stakeholder decisions. Cases serve as strategic drivers, guiding development and documenting the outcomes of experiments conducted under their scope.  

- **Experiments**  
  Experiments are sub-issues linked to Cases, representing focused initiatives or hypotheses to be tested. Each Experiment is assigned an owner responsible for leading the effort and producing results. Upon completion, Experiments result in a pull request (PR) to this repository to ensure that findings are documented, reviewed, and integrated.  

- **Tasks**  
  Tasks are sub-issues within Experiments and may reside in various repositories. Each Task is assigned to different engineers and tracked via GitHub Project boards. Tasks are completed when a documented PR is submitted, regardless of the destination repository. The Experiment owner sets the acceptance criteria and ensures that Tasks contribute directly to the broader goals of the Experiment.  

## Getting Started  

- **Check the Project Board** – See the current progress and Tasks.  
- **Explore the Issues** – Review existing Cases and Experiments to find areas where you can contribute.
- **Submit PRs** – Document your findings and contribute by submitting pull requests that enhance the knowledge repository.
