# Bref
Here you can find how we are working in the dev team and what dev team members
should to help other members be on the same page.

# Code contribution guide
Please find and read document `docs/proc/code_contribution_guide.md`.

# Releases
Each repository SHOULD have a release tag, and each tag should have a strong formatted text, which is: MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH. For forked repos that we are changing SHOULD be: FORKED_REPOS_MAJOR-FORKED_REPOS_MINOR-FORKED_REPOS_PATCH-MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH.

Example: let's say polkadotsdk has version 1.0.0, qf-solochain has version 0.5.0, then the full version is 1.0.0-0.5.0.

# Daily status reports
Each team member responsible for development SHOULD post a daily status report to related zulip channel. Key ideas behind this report is reduce number of calls and keep business team in the same page with dev team. However dev team members should keep GH's tickets upated no matter on this report.
