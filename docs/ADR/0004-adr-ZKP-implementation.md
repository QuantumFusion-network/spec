## Context
During the discussion of the Problem Statement and earlier in documents from stakeholders, the idea of using Zero Knowledge to increase blockchain data confidentiality appeared.

## Problem
In standard blockchain implementations, all transaction data is public and accessible for viewing by any network participant, and sometimes by any internet user. This creates problems for participants who would like to keep their financial operations or data secret.

## Decision
The QF blockchain will use Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to implement confidential transactions. The ZKP mechanism allows proving the truth of a statement (such as a transaction) without revealing the actual information on which the statement is based.

### Consequences
- **Positive**: 
  - Using ZKP will enhance confidentiality and allow hiding information about transactions and data recorded in the blockchain
  - Increase potential blockchain-based solutions, such as implementations of collaborative tools (document editing), voting systems, etc.
  - Enhanced security
  
- **Negative**: 
  - Significant increase in block size required to store information for confirmation using the ZKP mechanism
  - Complexity of ZKP implementation
  - High computational resource requirements for generating and verifying ZKPs

## Implementation Notes
Implementation will need to balance the confidentiality benefits with the increased resource requirements and complexity.
