name: Validation Experiment
about: Validates case acceptance criteria through consolidated demo workflows
title: '[ACCEPTANCE] [Case Name] Validation'
labels: 'experiment, acceptance, validation'
assignees: ''
---

[Validation Experiment writing rules:
- Demo Approach: Consolidate related acceptance criteria into natural workflow demos
- Stakeholder Friendly: Demos can be presented in stakeholder meetings to efficiently validate multiple criteria
- Natural Sequences: Follow real usage patterns, not artificial isolated tests
- Technical Focus: Document HOW to verify case acceptance criteria technically
- Detailed Procedures: Step-by-step validation that engineers can execute
- DRY: Reference case for acceptance criteria, don't copy them here
- Evidence-Based: Document what evidence proves criteria are met
- Validation Focus: Engineers use these demos to verify criteria; stakeholders observe demos in meetings]

## Prerequisites

[What needs to be in place before validation can begin]

**Environment Access Required:**
- [Server/system access needed]
- [Credentials or permissions]
- [Tools required - browsers, CLI, etc.]

**Setup Steps:**
- [Environment configuration]
- [Test data preparation]
- [Tool installation if needed]

## Validation Procedures

[Use consolidated demo workflows that verify multiple acceptance criteria in natural sequences. Each demo can be presented in stakeholder meetings to efficiently validate related criteria.]

---

### Demo 1: [Descriptive workflow name covering multiple criteria]

**Validates Criteria:**

**For [Agent Type 1]:**
- [Criterion 1 brief description]
- [Criterion 2 brief description]

**For [Agent Type 2]:**
- [Criterion 3 brief description]

**Procedure:**

1. **[First natural step in workflow]**
   - [Detailed action to perform]
   - [What to observe/verify]
   - [Commands or UI actions]

2. **[Second natural step]**
   - [Detailed action]
   - [Verification points]
   - [Tool usage if applicable]

3. **[Third natural step]**
   - [Detailed action]
   - [Evidence collection]

*Automated validation:* [If applicable: reference test script that automates this demo]

**Success Evidence:**
- [What specifically proves these criteria are met]
- [Observable behavior and outcomes, metrics, screenshots, logs]

---

### Demo 2: [Next workflow name covering different criteria]

**Validates Criteria:**

**For [Agent Type]:**
- [Criterion brief description]
- [Another criterion]

**Procedure:**

1. **[Natural workflow step]**
   - [Detailed action]
   - [Verification]

2. **[Next step]**
   - [Action]
   - [Evidence collection]

**Success Evidence:**
- [What proves success]
- [Demonstrable outcomes]

---

[Continue with additional demos as needed to cover all acceptance criteria. Optimize for the minimum number of demos and time needed, ensuring they cover the maximum criteria via natural workflows.]

## Results & Learning

[To be filled during and after validation execution - focus on the validation PROCESS, not outcomes]

**What Worked Well:**
- [Effective tools/approaches]
- [Clear documentation or procedures]
- [Good automation or tooling]
- [Demos that worked smoothly in stakeholder meeting]

**Process Issues:**
- [Confusing steps or unclear procedures]
- [Tool limitations - e.g., "CLI output barely understandable, should use dashboard"]
- [Missing documentation or prerequisites]
- [Time-consuming manual steps that should be automated]
- [Demos that were hard to present or took too long]

**Improvements for Future Validations:**
- [Better tools or approaches to use next time]
- [Documentation that needs updating]
- [Automation opportunities]
- [Demo workflow refinements for better presentation]

*Note: Validation OUTCOMES (whether criteria passed/failed) are documented in the parent case "Learning Outcomes" section, not here.*

## References & Links (Optional)

[Include when you need to reference test environments, data, or tools. Delete if not applicable.]

**Test Environments:**
- [Environment name]: [URL or access information]

**Test Data:**
- [Dataset location]: [Description]

**Validation Scripts:**
- [Script location]: [What demo it automates]
