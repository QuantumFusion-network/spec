## Implementation Phase

### Hypothesis

**Technical Approach**: [What we're implementing or testing - specific technology, method, or component]
**Expected Technical Outcome**: [Measurable technical results we expect to achieve]
**Validation Method**: [How we'll measure and verify the technical results â†’ see Validation Design]
**Parent Case Impact**: [How these technical results support parent case acceptance criteria]

[*Example: Technical Approach - Implement Redis caching for API responses; Expected Technical Outcome - API response times under 200ms for 95% of requests; Validation Method - Load testing with 1000 concurrent users measuring response times; Parent Case Impact - Enables "Users can search products within 1 second" acceptance criterion*]
