# R&D Process Glossary

This table contains terms specifically related to the research and development methodology used within QF Project. These terms describe different stages in the hypothesis-driven development approach, from initial ideas through investigation, testing, implementation, and verification. This table is particularly useful for understanding how new features and improvements are conceptualized, evaluated, and incorporated into the project.

| Term | Abbreviation | Description | Comment |
|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Backlog |  | A hypothesis that has been identified but not yet prioritized for investigation or development |  |
| Being investigated |  | A hypothesis that is currently under review to determine its feasibility and potential impact |  |
| Being tested |  | A hypothesis that is undergoing testing to verify its effectiveness |  |
| Blockchain |  | A hypothesis that relates to blockchain generally |  |
| Business roadmap | BRM | Planning document for business objectives |  |
| Consensus |  | A hypothesis that specifically investigates mechanisms for achieving agreement among multiple parties in a blockchain |  |
| Focus |  | Focus of hypothesis in Hypotheses list |  |
| Goal |  | A defined project objective or milestone. | Result that must be achieved. Used in roadmaps and task management. |
| High-Level  |  | A hypothesis that focuses on broad concepts, overall goals, or strategic consideration |  |
| Hypothesis |  | Documented idea for R&D in Hypotheses list |  |
| Hypothesis is rejected |  | A hypothesis that has been determined to be invalid or not worth pursuing |  |
| Implemented |  | A hypothesis that has been successfully integrated into the system or process |  |
| In developing (intermediate) |  | A hypothesis that is in the process of being developed but may require additional work |  |
| In development and implementation |  | A hypothesis that is being actively developed and implemented into the system or process |  |
| Low-Level |  | A hypothesis that focuses on granular details, specific components, or technical aspects of a system or process. e.g. focus on node execution, that not include in other sections |  |
| Models |  | A hypothesis that relates to mathematical representations, algorithms, or frameworks used | Includes simulation, math, and reward models. |
| Network&communication |  | A hypothesis that explores network infrastructure, communication protocols, or data transmission within blockchain networks |  |
| On Pause |  | A hypothesis that has been temporarily put on hold, either due to resource constraints, changes in priorities, or other factors |  |
| Security&Privacy |  | A hypothesis that explores security measures, privacy protections, or risk mitigation strategies within the blockchain context, including cryptographic techniques, access controls, and data confidentiality |  |
| Setting task for developers |  | A hypothesis that is being prepared for implementation, with specific tasks assigned to developers |  |
| SmartContract |  | A hypothesis that focuses on self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, running on a blockchain |  |
| Status |  | Hypothesis status in Hypotheses list |  |
| Storage |  | A hypothesis that relates to data storage systems, techniques, or solutions, such as databases, distributed ledgers,<br>decentralized storage networks, or data governance |  |
| Technical Roadmap | TRM | Strategic planning document for technical development. |  |
| UseCases |  | A hypothesis that explores potential applications, scenarios, or real-world examples of a technology or solution |  |
| Verification on customer's side |  | A hypothesis that has been implemented and is being evaluated by the customer to ensure it meets their requirements and expectations |  |
