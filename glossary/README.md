These terms describe different stages in the hypothesis-driven development approach, from initial ideas through investigation, testing, implementation, and verification. This glossary is particularly useful for understanding how new features and improvements are conceptualized, evaluated, and incorporated into the project.

### 3. [glossary-not used.md](./glossary-not used.md)
